Hello,

I investigated the leaked hashes and I found several vulnerabilities in your organization's password policy. 
The cryptographic hash functions used for all the leaked hashes is Message Digest (MD5), which is extremely common/standard. It has a weaker/more insecure hash algorithm and is prone to many collisions.

I could crack 13/19 passwords very easily using hashcat.com and the rockyou.txt wordlist

Following is what I conclude about the current organization password policy:
i)There is no rule regarding the minimum length of the password.
ii)There is no rule regarding the use of special characters in the password.

I'd like to suggest a few additional features, to make the policy stronger:
Minimum length of password: 8 
Familiar words/ common character combinations should not be allowed
User cannot use their username/ personal information as their password
Concept of password Salting can be implemented
An external password strength checking app can we used.

Furthermore, I would suggest that you use a strong password encryption mechanism to create hashes for the password based on SHA
